👋 Hi, I’m @rimachaib

👀 I’m interested in collaborating with other developers to build tools that help individuas work and live better.  As a former environmental scientist, I'm especially passionate about developing and providing new technologies to the environemntal industry.

🌱 After a deep dive into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I’m now learning React and building an application that helps environmental consultants streamline the process of fulfilling regulatory requirements throughout project timelines.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with other developers that are geared toward equity and inlcusivity, education, environment, and/or sustainability. 

📫 Feel free to connect with me at rima.chaib@gmail.com
