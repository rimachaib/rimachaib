👋 Hi, I’m **@rimachaib**

👀 I’m interested in collaborating with other developers and companies to build tools that help individuals work and live better.

🌱 After a deep dive into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I’m now learning React and building an application that helps environmental consultants streamline the process of fulfilling regulatory requirements throughout a project's timeline.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with other developers that are geared toward equity and inlcusivity, education, environment, and/or sustainability, or generally any tools or products helping us to live and work better.
